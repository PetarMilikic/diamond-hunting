# diamond-hunting
### :memo: Game description:
Diamond-hunting is a time-limited 3D game.
In a haunted city, a player must collect at
least 7 diamonds inside or outside buildings.
Time is limited to one and a half minutes. 
There is also an evil witch in the city that 
the player must beware of - the player must not touch the witch.
If a player collects at least seven diamonds within one and a half minutes,
he wins and can also walk around the city as much as he wants,
but beware of witches!
